This module allows employees to check-in or check-out by moving their avatar on a kanban board.

The kanban board also shows a quick overview of all employees, grouped by attendance type,
such as:

* 👋 Absent
* 🏢 Office
* 🏠 Home-Office
* 🚋 Travelling

On the right side of the kanban board, you can see certain key figures for the employee
such as overtime hours and remaining vacation time.

This module also adds the ability for employees to go on a break by using the kanban board.
Upon returning, they can end the break which will add the spent time to their attendance as
"break time". Once the employee checks out, they will be able to modify the total break time
if needed.
