This module allows employees to check-in or check-out by moving their avatar on a kanban board.

The kanban board also shows a quick overview of all employees, grouped by attendance type,
such as:

* 👋 Absent
* 🏢 Office
* 🏠 Home-Office
* 🚋 Travelling

On the right side of the kanban board, you can see certain key figures for the employee
such as overtime hours and remaining vacation time.

This module also adds the ability for employees to go on a break by using the kanban board.
Upon returning, they can end the break which will **end** the current attendance at the
start time of the break and it will **start** a new attendance from the end time of the break.
This will result in the employee having multiple attendance records for the day and the time
spent on break is the delta between these attendances.
